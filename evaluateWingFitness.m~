function [fitness] = evaluateWingFitness(wing)
% this functions purpose is to evauate a wing's fitness for use in a
% genetic algorithm. General functionality:
% mass ~~ 0 => fitness ~~ infinity
% mass ~~ infinity => fitness ~~ 0
% wing breaks => fitness ~~ 0

FOS = 1.5; %the factor of saftey for yielding
